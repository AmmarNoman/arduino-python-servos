# Arduino-Python 4-Axis Servo Control

Control four (or more) RC servos with Arduino and Python.

Please read the [associated blog post](https://bws428.github.io/notes/arduino-python-4-axis-servo/) for more details and a full description of the code.

Python 3.5: The use of `venv` is now recommended for creating virtual environments.

## Installation

Clone this repo onto your local machine as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bws428/arduino-python-servos.git servos
```

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd servos
```

## Create a Python 3 Virtual Environment

To ensure that all of the packages play nice with one another, we'll install a Python 3 virtual environment in a directory we'll name `venv`.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

## Usage
